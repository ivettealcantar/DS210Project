DS210- Final Project: Mass Incarceration Analysis Project
Project Overview
This project explores mass incarceration and crime rates in the U.S. (2001–2016), focusing on relationships between incarceration rates and crime rates. By leveraging graph-based analysis, statistical modeling, and visualization, this project uncovers trends and compares Arizona and Massachusetts, two states of personal significance to me. The results address my family's concerns regarding safety during my transition from Arizona to Massachusetts for college.
Key Objectives
Regression Modeling: Explore the relationship between incarceration and crime rates through linear and nonlinear regression.
Comparative Analysis: Focus on crime and incarceration trends in Arizona and Massachusetts.
Graph-Based Analysis: Use graph algorithms to identify state similarities and connectivity patterns.
Outlier Detection and Trend Analysis: Spot anomalies and visualize nationwide trends.
Dataset Details
Primary Dataset: crime_and_incarceration_by_state.csv
Contains annual crime, incarceration, and population data for each state.
Incarceration Rate: Calculated as prisoner_count/state_population×100,000
Crime Rate: Calculated as violent_crime_total/state_population×100,000
Fields:
jurisdiction: State name (used for filtering).
year: Year of data (used for time-series analysis).
prisoner_count and state_population: Inputs for incarceration rate calculation.
violent_crime_total and state_population: Inputs for crime rate calculation.
Supplemental Datasets:
prison_custody_by_state.csv: Additional incarceration data.
ucr_by_state.csv: Historical crime data.
Methodology
Data Cleaning:
Function: process_dataset
Purpose: Parse the raw dataset into valid records (CleanRecord) and log invalid ones (DirtyRecord).
Implementation:
let (clean_records, invalid_records) = process_dataset("crime_and_incarceration_by_state.csv")?;
Outcome: Invalid records (e.g., missing population data) are logged for transparency

Rate Calculations:
Calculated incarceration and crime rates per 100,000 residents to standardize comparisons.
Statistical Modeling:
Linear Regression: To establish the relationship between incarceration rates and crime rates.
Function: linear_regression
Equation: y=0.5904x+153.4366
Weak positive relationship between incarceration and crime rates.
Nonlinear Regression: To fit a quadratic model for a more accurate relationship between incarceration and crime rates
Function: nonlinear_regression
Equation: y=−0.0002x2+0.7764x+117.7482
Suggests diminishing returns of incarceration on crime reduction.
Graph-Based Analysis:
Graph Construction:
Function: construct_graph
Connects states with similar incarceration rates.
Degree Centrality:
Function: compute_degree_centrality
Measures the number of state-to-state connections in the similarity graph.
K-Core Subgraph:
Function: compute_k_core
Identifies highly connected state clusters.
Comparative Analysis:
Compared crime rates between Arizona and Massachusetts using:
Function: compare_states
Function: perform_t_test
T-Test Result:
t-statistic: 0.03560., p-value: 0.9718
No statistically significant difference in crime rates.
Visualizations:
Plotted trends, comparisons, and outliers using plotters:
Bar charts (average incarceration rates).
Line graphs ( nationwide trends).

Key Results
Arizona's Higher Crime Rates:
Despite fluctuations, Arizona's crime rates remain higher overall, even as incarceration rates have increased.
Arizona Trends Over Time
The incarceration rate consistently increased over the years, peaking around 2010–2014 before slightly declining toward 2016.
The crime rate initially fluctuated slightly from 2001 to 2005 but began a noticeable decline starting in 2006, reaching its lowest point around 2014. However there is an upward trend observed in 2015–2016, suggesting a rebound in crime rates toward the end of the period.
Trend compared to Massachuesetts: Arizona (blue line) consistently had higher crime rates compared to Massachusetts (red line) for most years.
Massachusetts Trends Over Time
The incarceration rate in Massachusetts is consistently low compared to national levels and shows a gradual decline over the years.
The crime rate in Massachusetts declines steadily across the time period.
Massachusetts maintains a relatively low incarceration rate throughout the observed period, which contrasts sharply with states like Arizona. Despite having a lower incarceration rate, crime rates in Massachusetts consistently declined. This suggests that the state achieved crime reductions without heavy reliance on incarceration.
National Trends:
Nationwide incarceration and crime rates generally declined from 2001 to 2016.
State Comparisons:
Arizona and Massachusetts show no statistically significant difference in crime rates (p=0.97).
 Graph Analysis:
Highly connected states: California, Colorado, and Illinois.
Outliers: Alaska (high crime rates in 2011–2014).
Centrality States:
High Degree Centrality States:
States such as Illinois, Indiana, California, Montana, and Vermont show the highest degree centrality values (around 2000).
These states have strong interconnections with other states, indicating similar incarceration rates compared to many others.
Medium Degree Centrality States:
States like Arizona, Massachusetts, Maine, and South Carolina have moderate degree centrality values (~1000–1500).
These states exhibit fewer but still notable connections with other states.
Low Degree Centrality States:
States such as Alaska, Delaware, Oklahoma, and Texas have the lowest degree centrality values, indicating fewer connections.
This suggests that their incarceration rates differ significantly from most other states.


Other code used
1. Checking Dataset Existence

if !std::path::Path::new("crime_and_incarceration_by_state.csv").exists() {
    eprintln!("Dataset file not found. Please ensure the file is present.");
    return Ok(());
}

Ensures required files are present before running.
2. Linear Regression

let slope = x.iter().zip(y.iter()).map(|(xi, yi)| (xi - mean_x) * (yi - mean_y)).sum::<f32>()
    / x.iter().map(|xi| (xi - mean_x).powi(2)).sum::<f32>();

Fits a line to describe the relationship between incarceration and crime rates.
3. Graph Construction

for i in 0..records.len() {
    for j in i + 1..records.len() {
        let rate_diff = (state1.incarceration_rate - state2.incarceration_rate).abs();
        if rate_diff < 50.0 {
            graph.add_edge(idx1, idx2, rate_diff);
        }
    }
}

Builds a similarity graph connecting states with close incarceration rates.
